Objective:
The main objective of this lab was to design a program that calculates the total cost of flooring for five rooms based on user input for room dimensions and flooring type. We were supposed to learn how to design an algorithm, implement the solution using functions, and ensure proper input validation while testing the program for correctness.
Procedure:
The steps we followed aligned with the 3 main rules of programming: understanding the problem, designing a solution, and executing/testing.
1.	Understanding the Problem: We identified the key requirements, including prompting the user for room dimensions, validating input, calculating the area, and then determining the cost based on the flooring type. We created test cases on excel to help us for later as well. 
2.	Designing the Algorithm: Liv and I worked together on the algorithm. We created clear steps for how to handle user input, calculate the cost, and handle multiple rooms. This helped us break down the problem into manageable pieces, such as functions for getting dimensions, getting the flooring type, and calculating the room cost.
3.	Execution and Testing: Liv initially wrote the program based on our algorithm, and I edited and touched it up, ensuring it followed our design. We tested the program with different inputs to make sure it handled edge cases, such as invalid dimensions and flooring types. We also tried typical and extreme cases (using our test cases) to check the accuracy of the calculations.
Results:
The results matched what we expected. The program correctly calculated the total cost for all five rooms and handled invalid input properly. We used several test cases, including cases where users entered invalid data (like negative room dimensions or incorrect flooring types) to ensure the program handled errors properly.
Reflection:
Challenges: One challenge we encountered was ensuring that the input validation worked consistently. We had to fine-tune the loops to prevent the program from accepting invalid data. However, once we understood how to structure the validation, it worked smoothly.

Following the 3 Rules:
1.	Understand the Problem: Liv and I discussed the problem requirements thoroughly, which helped us avoid confusion during the coding phase.
2.	Design Using an Algorithm: The algorithm we created together was a good start. It helped us stay organized and ensured that each function had a clear purpose.
3.	Execute and Test: We spent time testing the program with various inputs to ensure it worked as expected. We focused on making sure the logic flowed smoothly from start to finish.
Overcoming Challenges: We overcame the challenges of input validation, functions, and error-checking through trial and error. We had to test and refine multiple times, and collaborate, but eventually we were successful. 
Key Takeaways: One of the most valuable things I practiced in this lab was how to break down a program into smaller functions. By organizing the code into distinct functions, each handling a specific task like getting room dimensions or calculating the room cost, it made the program easier to manage and debug. This also reinforced how important functions are for creating reusable and modular code. Additionally, practicing error checking was a key takeaway for me too. 
Collaboration: Working with Liv was a great experience. She did an excellent job on the initial version of the program, and we communicated well throughout the process. Editing the code after Liv’s work allowed me to refine it while ensuring we followed our original algorithm.
Overall, I think we accomplished what we were supposed to learn in this lab. We successfully designed and implemented the program, tested it thoroughly, and applied the three rules of programming effectively.
